Parse parameters
	Check if it's a flag
		If so, change smth in flags structure

	If not, then probably it's a bot
		Try opening this file and read 0 bytes from it
			On success, put it's fd into the array
				If array is full, ERROR

		If cannot open, ERROR

Initialize
	Initialize arena

	Read bots and check them
		Go through an array of fds
			For every fd read code from it into the buffer
				Check the code
					WRITE SOMETHING HERE PLEASE

					On error ERROR

				If all's ok, write it on arena(we can calculate the position of the bot)
					Initialize a carriage for a bot(put it into stack or queue or whatever)

Pray

Play
	Carriages action
		Go through carriages stack(queue(whatever))
			For every carriage determine operation, parameters
				Execute them
					WRITE SOMETHING HERE PLEASE

	If there is output flag, call the output function, pass there a flag and a structure
		In that function call the appropriate ouput function(ncurses, output, sfml)

	If Cycle > Cycle_to_die
		Check players
			If player hasn't said "live" for 2 cycles - mark him as dead
			
			If there r no players alive, end

		Check carriages
			If carriage hasn't said "live" for 2 cycles - delete it from stack(heap(tree(queue(list(whatever)))))
