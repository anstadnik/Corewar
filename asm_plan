1. Read the file.
	1.1. All possible checkings: whitespaces are skipped, the number of possible commands is strictly
	 	 determined as well as the structure of a .cor file.
	1.2. Validation stage.
# lseek?
2. Parse the file.
	2.0. Remember commands' indexes, indexes of labels (used bytes before + 1), then read again. We might do it together with validation.
	2.1. Transform everything into binary using 0,1 from ASCII. (Probably we'll write a new mode for itoa_base).
	2.2. Create a static buffer where we will write all ours bytecode. Once it full, we will simply send it to dprintf

	(We always pay attention to the first label if there are more).
	(t_list for saving labels' names and their coordinates).
	(big list of command structures)
	('a label can have no instruction following it or to be placed on a line before the instruction it responds to.') - needs some testing.
	{
		char	*command;
		char	*label;
		t_arg	*arg1;
		t_arg	*arg2;
		t_arg	*arg3;
		size_t	index;
	}
	t_arg
	{	
		char arg; // T_REG | T_DIR | T_IND
		char label_flag; // 1 | 0
		char *value;
	}
3. Close the file.
4. Chunga-changa veselo zhivem.

issues

1. FFF8, zork. Why the heck label's adress turns out to be so big(uint16_t - 8)
(MEM_SIZE * 16 - ((command index relatively to zero) - (label index relatively to zero))) % MEM_SIZE * 16

0a in end of file (no eto ne tochno)
